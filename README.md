# Needfinding

> This was an old/outdated fork of a GitHub repository as part of a Brooklyn College group project, now deleted by the leader of the project, from April 2024 - May 2024 Contributers: Jessica Jiang, Jonathan Ma, Vincent Chen, Wei Cheng Zhu, and Wei Jian Zhen.

The development of any software project begins with identifying the needs of your users.
Remember: we want to build programs that are useful in addition to usable. ˆ
You as the developer cannot determine what is useful to your users; only they can tell you.
Your goal with this project is to draw out users’ needs using contextual inquiry. (We will be
using the term user to refer to the potential user whom you will be observing/interviewing
during this activity.)

In this assignment, keep in mind the goal of designing a program that will benefit the public
good of the Brooklyn College / CUNY / NYC community. You don’t need to have a firm idea
of a product idea yet – in fact, you shouldn’t, since the goal of this exercise is to identify needs
that you can address with your product – but you should have some glimmers of ideas that
will guide you to identify a target audience and environment.
To conduct needfinding:

1. Identify the core demographic that you will target your product to. Include anything
   of importance – age, gender, education level, geographic location, etc. You don’t have
   to be overly specific if it’s not warranted; e.g., an app help navigate the Brooklyn
   College campus would be targeted to Brooklyn College students/faculty/staff, but an
   app to help manage course schedules and workload would be more generally targeted
   to college students in general.
   Note: you do not have to target college students, but you should have some strong
   familiarity with and access to the demographic that you target. You will need to be
   able to conduct contextual inquiry on your potential users.

2. Identify (at least) three “types” of individuals in your core demographic that differ in
   some meaningful way that is relevant to your program. (Examples might include:
   level of experience with technology, gender, age, roles, geographic location, major).

3. Sketch a plan for how you will conduct contextual inquiry with these participants. Try
   to where, when, and how (the who, what and why should be obvious). If the
   procedure would be different for different participants, explain how and why they
   would differ. For example, if you are creating a campus app, you might target common
   locations where people might get lost or need assistance.

4. Go forth and conduct the contextual inquiry with (at least) three participants. Take
   pictures (if your participants agree)! You MUST actually observe and interview at
   least three potential users, in person and in the location where your product is
   most likely to be used.
   Recall that the core components of contextual inquiry are:
   • Context: Inquiry is conducted in the users’ own space. The researcher watches users do
   their activities and discusses the process with them.
   • Partnership—User and researcher collaborate to understand the user's activity. The
   interview alternates between observing the user as he or she works and discussing what
   the user did and why.
   • Interpretation—The researcher shares interpretations and insights with the user
   during the interview. The user may expand or correct the researcher's understanding.
   • Focus—The researcher steers the interaction towards topics which are relevant to the
   team's scope.
   (adapted slightly from the Wikipedia article)
   To actually conduct contextual inquiry, you will want to:
   • Head to the location(s) where you hope to find users.
   • Introduce yourself, explain what you will be doing (including method of recording
   data – will you just be taking notes? recording video or audio? -- and the
   confidentiality of those recordings), and ask the user if they consent.
   • Watch the user do their activity (e.g. navigating the campus, checking out books in the
   library, waiting on line in an office). Observe what occurs and any problems that the
   user faces and discuss your observations with the user. Take notes.
   • Finally, wrap-up: summarize what you observed so that the user can correct or clarify
   if necessary. Thank the user for their time.
   When you are done, briefly summarize what you observed/found/noticed. Include relevant
   quotes, insights, photos and surprising findings.

5. Analyze new and existing tasks that your application enables. Describe three to five
   tasks in moderate detail that users will perform with your top application idea.

6. You do not have to submit anything yet, but you will need to submit a summary of
   your core demographic, which three “types” of user you identified, how you
   conducted contextual inquiry (be very specific – where, when, with whom, what
   happened, how), a summary of your findings, and a plan for your website based on
   contextual inquiry.
